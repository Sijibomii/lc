1 - 100
after 1 - 100 for each section. take a week off for revision without looking at answers

steps: 
1. identify ds and algo suitable for modelling problem
2. write soln

Pro-tip: if you can draw the problem in a tree or graph structure consider dfs algo for backtracking while processing the nodes as you go down
for a question. draw the decision tree. if you can draw a graph, then dp, backtracking can be used to solve and cache for efficiency.
